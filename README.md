# Credit-Risk-Classification

## Background
It's time to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is evaluate the accuracy, precision and recall score of the model chosen to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Technologies
* Jupyter notebook.
* Pandas.
* Sklearn.
* Python.

## Instruction
* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Predicta logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
